# M-Pesa-Statements-Analysis

## Overview
M-Pesa, Kenya's leading mobile money service, powers everyday payments. 
I dug into my M-Pesa statements for the year 2024 to see where my money went â€” spoiler alert: a lot went to M-Shwari and mutura!ðŸ˜‚
I cleaned the data, categorized my spending (Send Money, Pochi La Biashara, Till Numbers, Paybills), calculated the total amount I spent on transaction costs for the, created interactive visualizations with Plotly Express and so much more.

## Dataset
The data comes from `2024_MPesa_Statements.csv`(which is basically my M-Pesa statement for the year 2024).
The data has the following with columns:
- `Receipt_No`: Transaction ID
- `Completion_Time`: Date and time of transaction
- `Details`: Transaction description
- `Transaction_Status`: Status of transaction
- `Received`: Money received (KES)
- `Withdrawn`: Money spent (KES)
- `Balance`: Account balance (KES)
Unfortunately I cannot include the dataset here for personal reasons. If you need data for such a project you can always request a yearly M-Pesa statement using MY Safaricom app.

## Objectives
To find:
- Total money received and spent.
- Spending breakdown by category (e.g., Send Money, Paybill).
- Monthly and daily spending patterns, including my highest spending day.
- Transaction costs and daily averages.
- Fun analysis: How much I spent on mutura!

## Methodology
### 1. Data Cleaning
- Dropped unnecessary `Unnamed` columns.
- Converted `Received`, `Withdrawn`, and `Balance` to floats, handling commas and negatives (used `.abs()` for withdrawals).
- Transformed `Completion_Time` into `Date` and `Time` columns using `pd.to_datetime`.

### 2. Analysis
- **Totals**: Summed `Received` and `Withdrawn` for net earnings (-KES 15,453).
- **Categories**: Grouped spending into Send Money, Pochi la Biashara, Till Numbers, Paybill Numbers, M-Shwari Deposits, and Airtime Purchases.
- **Monthly Spending**: Aggregated by month, sorted chronologically.
- **Daily Spending**: Identified highest spending day (9 Sept 2024, KES 23,099, excluding M-Shwari and Send Money).
- **Transaction Costs**: Calculated using M-Pesa tariffs, averaged 6.14 transactions and KES 8.32 daily.
- **Mutura Purchases**: Filtered for vendor "GIDRAPH GACIBU"(my mutura plug), counted 62 transactions.

### 3. Visualization
